# Pyspark / Hadoop Distributed File System Test
The test is a simple demonstration of Pyspark and HDFS.

It demonstrates:
- Pyspark DataFrames with an SQL insertion as well as a manual Pandas transpose.
- A test of Hadoop through an InsecureClient, which has its status run to decide  whether it has to delete a specific directory or not.
- Shown DataFrames throughout the process.

Though Big Data Management is not truly demonstrated in the test, a heavy focus on configuration management.
