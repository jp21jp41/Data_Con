Lottery Data Conversion

A basic conversion of Data.Gov data on lottery which takes the data to convert into a set of statistics.

The resulting format: four excel files of various time scales, each with an Initial Data sheet, an Averages sheet, and an Advanced Statistics sheet, all in one folder.
The main statistics throughout: Averages, Sums, Variances, and Standard Deviations, of winning numbers at a given timespan.
 
Note that the project only has one developer, so it takes time to make improvements. That also means the limitations are bound to said one developer.
