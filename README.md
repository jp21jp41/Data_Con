# L_D_Con
Lottery Data Conversion

A basic conversion of Data.Gov data on lottery which takes the data to convert into a set of statistics.

The resulting format: four excel files of various time scales, each with an Initial Data sheet, an Averages sheet, and an Advanced Statistics sheet, all in one folder.
The main statistics throughout: Averages, Sums, Variances, and Standard Deviations, of winning numbers at a given timespan.

# Instructions

On line 19 of the Lottery_Data_Conversion.py file, replace the directory (which is, "Lottery_Mega_Millions_Winning_Numbers__Beginning_2002.csv") with
your directory. Then, you may simply run the file to get all of the data.

Note that the project only has one developer, so it takes time to make improvements. That also means the limitations are bound to said one developer.
